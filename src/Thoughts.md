Somehow the structure I have in mind is slightly different
- Queue is of specific type, i.e. scheduling algorithm. Queue has a scheduler of that type. Or rather we can say that Queue is mostly same, just the scheduling algorithm changes. But in order to carry out the scheduling the row of the table needs to be of a specific type to track the scheduling variables




- Queue implemented as a MarkdownTable
- Queue node implemented as MarkdownTableRow
